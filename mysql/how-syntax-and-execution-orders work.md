[How Syntax order and Execution order work at MySQL]

Syntax order -> Execution order

- Syntax Order

1. SELECT

2. FROM

3. WHERE

4. GROUP BY

5. HAVING

6. ORDER BY

- Execution Order

1. FROM → Go to the location where the data exists

2. WHERE → Filter only the data that meets the conditions

3. GROUP BY → Aggregate the data as desired

4. HAVING → Filter the aggregated data based on conditions

5. SELECT → Retrieve the final data

6. ORDER BY → Sort the result

[How Aliases work]

If a table alias is defined in the FROM clause (e.g., FROM Table1 AS T1), <br>
it can be used in the SELECT and ORDER BY clauses (e.g., SELECT T1.Col1, ORDER BY T1.Col1).

If a column alias is defined in the SELECT clause (e.g., SELECT T1.Col1 AS TC),<br>
it can be used in the ORDER BY clause (e.g., ORDER BY TC).

Note that T1.TC cannot be used in ORDER BY; cause TC replaces T1.Col1
